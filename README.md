# snakebali
This is an experimental Snake game.

In retrospect, it would have been more efficient and sensible to use the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to build the gameplay element.

## Setup
- Go into the `snakebali` directory
- Run `npm start` to run the project locally
